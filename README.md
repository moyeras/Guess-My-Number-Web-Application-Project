# Guess My Number Game ðŸŽ®

## Description
**Guess My Number** is a simple browser-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 20. The player is given feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game keeps track of the player's score, which decreases with each incorrect guess. If the player wins, their highscore is updated.
